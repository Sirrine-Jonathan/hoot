# Hoot: The AI Teacher Agent - TODO 🦉

This list tracks the remaining features and refinements planned for Hoot.

## 🚀 High Priority (Phase 5: Interactivity)
- [ ] **Interactive Quizzes:** Implement a "Pop Quiz" button in the sidebar. Hoot should generate a 3-question quiz based on the current file or project architecture.
- [ ] **Interactive Challenges:** Let Hoot generate a small file with intentional logical bugs and ask the user to fix it to reinforce a concept.
- [ ] **Copy Button:** Add a "Copy" button to all code blocks in the chat interface.

## 🎓 Learning Experience (Phase 4: Structured Content)
- [ ] **Welcome Walkthrough:** Create a native VS Code Walkthrough (`contributes.walkthroughs`) that guides new users through setting their API key and using the Shadow Teacher.
- [ ] **Learning Snapshots:** A "What I Learned Today" button that generates a Markdown summary of the day's Socratic interactions.
- [ ] **Shadow Teacher Personalities:** Allow users to choose between "Direct Mentor," "Philosophical Sage," or "Strict Professor" modes.

## 🏗️ Architectural & Performance
- [ ] **Project Index Caching:** Cache the project map results to improve response times for large workspaces.
- [ ] **Deep Link Integration:** Allow Hoot to send a message that, when clicked, opens a specific file and highlights a specific line range.
- [ ] **Streaming Responses:** Implement full streaming for Gemini responses in the sidebar for a more modern chat feel.

## 🎨 UI & Branding
- [ ] **CodeLens Colors:** Customize the theme colors for Hoot's CodeLenses to make them distinct but non-distracting.
- [ ] **Marketplace Assets:** Create final screenshots and a high-quality promo video using the cinematic assets in `resources/`.
