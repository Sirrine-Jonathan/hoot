# Continuity Prompt: VS Code "Teacher Agent" (hoot)

**Project:** `hoot` - A VS Code extension that acts as an AI-powered "Teacher Agent" to help users learn coding concepts.

**Current Status:**

- The project has been successfully scaffolded in the `C:\Users\jonat\~projects\hoot` directory.
- All prior research and planning documents have been consolidated into the `C:\Users\jonat\~projects\hoot\docs` folder. The primary technical blueprint is `docs/vscode_extension_deep_dive.md`.
- This `prompt.md` file was created to bridge the context between work environments.

**User's Instructions & Next Steps:**

1.  **Primary Task:** The user has instructed me to read the `vsc-extension-quickstart.md` file located in the root of the `hoot` project for guidance.
2.  **Immediate Goal:** After reviewing the quickstart, the next objective is to begin cleaning up the boilerplate code from the initial scaffold. This involves:
    - Modifying `src/extension.ts` to remove the "Hello World" command logic.
    - Modifying `package.json` to remove the "Hello World" command contribution and activation event.
    - Preparing to implement the first feature: the sidebar chat Webview, as detailed in our research.

Also, assets here that should be moved into an appropriate folder:
C:\Users\jonat\~projects\hoot\*.png
These should be used to brand the hoot extension.
